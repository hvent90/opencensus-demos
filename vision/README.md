# vision-api

## About
This example shows how to use both the trace and stats/exporters to 
instrument your backend. The API sends information both to Prometheus
and to StackDriver monitoring sending spans of methods invoked.

The API server presented is one a company might use for
their app and its purpose is to give them information about their
backend's usage e.g:
* images processed
* methods used i.e. upload with body vs by URI
* bytes processsed altogether
* the performance and time spent within each service
* error rates

The information collected will help their engineering teams
figure out what services to optimize for, what metrics
their business development team will present, the popularity
of their service, general performance, error rates.

## Installing it
```shell
$ go get -u -v github.com/orijtech/opencensus-demos/vision
```

## Running it
```shell
$ GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/Downloads/census-demos-237a8e1e41df.json vision --gcp-id census-demos
```
where
* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/Downloads/census-demos-237a8e1e41df.json`
an alternate way of setting the Google authentication credentials if you didn't
set them in your environment already
* `--gcp-id`: the ID of the project

### Browser app
You can visit http://localhost:8899/

### Commandline app
Please see the routes sub-section and sample responses

## Routes
Route|Purpose
---|---
/upload|Multipart uploads for content say from your filesystem
/metrics|Prometheus exporter route
/url|JSON based API invocation


## Sample response using JSON based route "/url"

```shell
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8899/url --data '{"url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4898263?s=460&v=4"}'
```
which gives
```JSON
